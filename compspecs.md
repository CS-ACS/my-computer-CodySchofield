## H3 Commentary
* I got this computer two years ago, new, for school. I use it for drawing and writing,  
and up until now it hasn't left my desk, so it's weird to see the battery level go down.
* My computer has pretty amazing preformance, but it slows down at around 30 tabs, and  
when I'm playing most video games. You'd think with 8 GB of RAM it'd be able to handle  
more chrome tabs, but I think my computer isn't great at prioritization.
